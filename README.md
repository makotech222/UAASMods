Instructions:
Install the Equipment mod using UnityModManager, start the game and load up a save. Loading a game will cause the mod to export the Rifles.txt and Cannons.txt files to the Mod's install folder inside the game directory. Exit the game, and open the two text files. You can edit the stats
of the items here. When the game is loaded again, the mod will read these files and apply them to the items.
Do not edit the 'ID' property, as it is needed to apply properly. Editing the equipment description or name is not yet supported. 

For ShipModules, you cannot edit title, effect, or description. You can add as many modifier as you want, but probably don't remove any (not tested).
